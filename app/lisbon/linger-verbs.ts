/**
 * Per-POI linger verbs and their game-minute quanta.
 *
 * Per the M1 PR5 brief, the drawer's third button slot reads as a verb
 * specific to the POI type — "Sleep until morning" at the hostel, "Watch
 * the planes" at the transit hub, "Take it in" at the view, etc. The
 * brief also defines a night-closure rule: most POIs read as closed at
 * night and the linger button disables; the hostel is the only "always
 * available" verb at night because sleep is what nights are for.
 *
 * Verb wording is *placeholder* at M1 PR5 — the Narrative Designer will
 * polish in M3 (per the comment at the verb-table site in the brief).
 * The shape of this module (per-type verb + dynamic quantum) is what
 * matters; the strings are tuneable.
 *
 * The function takes `epochMinute` rather than reading from the
 * `useGameClockStore` directly so it stays a pure function — easy to
 * test, easy to call from non-React surfaces (e.g., a future ADR's
 * server-side getter).
